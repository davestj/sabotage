# Listen all ya'll this is Docker Sabotage

## Introduction - Meet Mr. Mayhem in code

Docker Sabotage is your trusty chaos engineering companion for stirring up a bit of controlled mayhem in your Docker environment. With a name that's both ominous and mischievous, Sabotage helps you identify weaknesses, fortify resilience, and inject a healthy dose of chaos into your DevSecOps practices.

## What is Chaos Engineering?

Chaos engineering is like stress testing on steroids. It's the art of breaking things to make them stronger. By simulating real-world disasters and malicious attacks, chaos engineering helps you build more resilient and secure systems that can withstand the unpredictable.

## Why Use Docker Sabotage?

### DevSecOps Integration:
Docker Sabotage seamlessly integrates into the DevSecOps pipeline, allowing security and operations teams to collaborate in a chaotic yet controlled environment. Together, they can identify vulnerabilities, fortify security postures, and ensure continuous delivery of secure and resilient systems.

### Resilience Testing:
In the world of chaos engineering, resilience is the name of the game. Docker Sabotage helps you stress-test your Docker containers by randomly terminating them, allowing you to evaluate the resilience of your systems and ensure high availability and business continuity.

### Fun with Chaos and Mayhem:
Who said chaos can't be fun? With Docker Sabotage, you can embrace the chaos with a smile. Just sit back, relax, and watch as Sabotage wreaks havoc in your Docker environmentâ€”all in the name of improving security and fortifying resilience.

## Getting Started

To unleash chaos with Docker Sabotage, follow these steps:

1. **Install Docker**: Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine.
2. **Install Python**: Sabotage is a Python script, so ensure you have Python installed as well.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Use pip to install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install docker
   ```

4. **Run Sabotage**: Fire up the Sabotage script with the desired parameters and watch the chaos unfold (in a controlled manner, of course)!

## Usage

Here's a taste of how to use Docker Sabotage:

```
python sabotage.py --count <number-of-containers>
```

Replace `<number-of-containers>` with the desired number of Docker containers to terminate.
